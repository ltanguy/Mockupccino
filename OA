       Mockupccino is a REST/JSON server simulation tool which allow developers to test their REST clients.

       Mockupccino  doesn't  require  any  intrusive  configuration into your projects, just run Mockupccino with its configuration file and that's all.  The main objective of
       Mockupccino is to prevent your projects from the risk of webservices connection bugs that could be caused by an intrusive faulty configuration.  Its use was thought  to
       be as simple as possible, you just have to create a file that describes how the REST webservice must respond and launch the Mockupccino server.
